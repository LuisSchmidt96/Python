# Wattpad-webscraper
A python-based webscraper I made to find my friend's embarrassing One Direction-fanfic.
Can be modified to find other items on wattpad, replace the url with the one with the api directory from the corresponding search term and adjust the search parameters.
Prints out the findings in the Python shell and also writes an excel file.
